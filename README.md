# PrecisionMedicineFeatureExtraction

## This docker will do feature extraction for clustering latent vectors from a vcf for deep learning 

#### Learning is not implemented yet

## What's the problem?

#### GWAS is not sufficient and clustering methods are not simple enough to be implemented by most bioinformaticians

## Why should we solve it?

#### Because we can bridge the gap between computer science and bioinformatics!

# What is Recurrent Deep Embedding Networks for Genotype Clustering and Ethnicity Prediction?

+ A software package that is awesome, but very complicated to run.  

+ We would eventually like to tag this onto a variant annotator such that one can annotate variants and networks with opencravat:

# git clone this repo to use it! There is a dockerfile, but you need to provision your own java within it!
